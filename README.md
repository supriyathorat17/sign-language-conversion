Sign language to text conversion using CNN
• Developed an AI-powered system using TensorFlow and OpenCV to translate sign language gestures into speech and text, enabling
over 85% accuracy in real-time communication for individuals with speech and hearing disabilities.
• Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 10,000+ gesture images to accurately recognize 26 distinct hand
gestures corresponding to alphabet letters, achieving a 92% accuracy rate on test data.
• Implemented a three-module system for image capture, feature extraction (color and shape detection), and pattern generation, reducing
translation time by 30%, ensuring seamless gesture-to-text conversion.
